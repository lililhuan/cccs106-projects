# Lab 2 Report: Git Version Control and Flet GUI Development

**Student Name:** Roinel James A. Llesis
**Student ID:** 231004336
**Section:** BSCS-3B
**Date:** 09/09/2025

## Git Configuration

### Repository Setup
- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/lililhuan/cccs106-projects.git
- **Local Repository:** ✅ Initialized and connected
- **Commit History:** 5 commits with descriptive messages

### Git Skills Demonstrated
- ✅ Repository initialization and configuration
- ✅ Adding, committing, and pushing changes
- ✅ Branch creation and merging
- ✅ Remote repository management

## Flet GUI Applications

### 1. hello_flet.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Interactive greeting, student info display, dialog boxes
- **UI Components:** Text, TextField, Buttons, Dialog, Containers
- **Notes:** There is no any challenges for me since it run smoothly however, in my observation you can only enter a one character like for example you can only enter a name but can't enter or put a student Id or Program and about the app info i think it's not working but the other button is working and thats all thank you!

### 2. personal_info_gui.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Form inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, profile generation
- **UI Components:** TextField, Dropdown, RadioGroup, Containers, Scrolling
- **Error Handling:** Input validation and user feedback
- **Notes:** There is no challenges also for me since it also run smoothly and for my obeservation all the feature are working but there is something that catch my intention the color of the text when you generate profile it's not visible for the user, thats all and i thankyou!

## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository concepts
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branch management and merging
- Remote repository collaboration

### Flet GUI Development
- Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components
- Page configuration and layout management
- Event handling and user interaction
- Modern UI design principles

## Challenges and Solutions

there is no challenges or error i encounter since i follow the instruction. it flow smoothly when i doing this but there is a little bit of a confusion but i ask for help in google and i solve it.

## Learning Outcomes

I also got to know that version control is quite handy as it keeps the track of the changes in a project. I will have an opportunity to revert to a previous copy in case of error. It also facilitates easier work with other people as all their work can be pooled together.

Through the development of GUI I learnt how to make programs user-friendly. I am able to develop buttons, windows and input boxes that are more user friendly in lieu of text commands.

I studied that teamwork is a thing to work in collaborative programming. GitHub and similar tools: With this tool we are able to share our code, eliminate conflicts, and even fully back up to work on another section of the project simultaneously. It demonstrated to me that communication and task organization is equally significant to writing the code.

- [ ] Local git log showing commits

### GUI Applications
- [ ] hello_flet.py running with all features
- [ ] personal_info_gui.py with filled form and generated profile

## Future Enhancements

In the future enchacement in the application i think we need to improve the GUI and the buttons since the other buttons is not working and  also about the choosing the color of the text i think need to improve since it not visible to the user and that's all thankyou!
